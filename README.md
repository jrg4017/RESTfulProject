# RESTfulProject

A project to experiment and play with RESTful API, AJAX, and with jQuery Plugins.

The project required the use of 4 jQuery plugins, the use of AJAX and RESTful api to extract information from XML web pages.
The project can only be viewed on RIT's network as the server can only be accessed from there. A video will be up shortly regarding
the website so you have access to a visual representation as well as the code.
